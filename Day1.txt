- Git is the engine: it handles version control, commits, branches, and merges.
- GitHub is the garage: it stores your Git repositories online, making them accessible to others and adding collaboration tools.

git init → Created a new Git repository at C:/Users/dell/Desktop/personal
git add . → This command added all the files in the folder to the staging area.
